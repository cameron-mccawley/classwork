ASSIGNMENT #5

NAME: Cameron McCawley

DESCRIPTION: An implementation of a linked list class "from scratch". The user will get to choose to 
either make a list of ints or unsigned ints.  The user will be able to add elements to the list by 
appending, pushing, or inserting.  When finished, the user can sort the list in ascending order or
descending order via merge-sort.  The program will also print out the number of prime numbers in 
the list via the Miller-Rabin primality test.  The user will be able to choose to make another list.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN: type 'make' to compile, run with './app'

EXTRA CREDIT USED: Implemented the assignment using template classes.
